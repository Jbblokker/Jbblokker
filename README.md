Welcome to my GitHub Page!
<br>
<br>
I'm a newly trained Web Developer after spending nearly eight years in Service and Management in the Agriculture business. I have recently moved from the United States ✈️ to Germany and am ready to start working here in this endlesslessly stunning country. 
<br>
<br>
When I am not studying new code or working on bettering my code, I like to catch as many bike rides as I can with my son. 🚴‍♂️
<br>
<br>
Feel free to check out some of my pins to see what I have been up to, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to e-mail me.
