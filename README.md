I'm a Junior Developer with experience in working in a remote start-up here in Germany :european_castle:. In my previous life, I spent nearly eight years in Service and Management in the Agriculture business. I am originally from the United States but have moved ✈️ to Germany in the past year and I have enjoyed working here in this endlesslessly stunning country.

<br>
When I am not studying new code or working on bettering my code, I like to catch as many bike rides as I can with my son. 🚴‍♂️
